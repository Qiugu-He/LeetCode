## #121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock    
Given a an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

```
    Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```


## Dynamic programming: 
```Java
    /*
        TotalProfit = sum i { height(peak i) - height(valley i) }

        Time complexity : O(n)
        Space complexity : O(1)
    */

    class Solution {
        public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
            int i = 0;
            int valley = prices[0];
            int peak = prices[0];
            int maxprofit = 0;
            while (i < prices.length - 1) {
                while (i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] >= prices[i + 1])
                    i++;
                valley = prices[i];
                while (i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] <= prices[i + 1])
                    i++;
                peak = prices[i];
                maxprofit += peak - valley;
            }
            return maxprofit;
        }
}

```
